# The Game #

Atomix is a sliding puzzle game.  The idea is to assemble a molecule from individual atoms by sliding them around. The problem is that once you set an atom moving it will continue moving until it hits another atom or a wall.

Select an atom by clicking on it. Set an atom in motion by clicking on one of the arrows that appear when you select it.

An image of the molecule you are to assemble appears to the right of the field, this image can be dragged with the mouse.

You can assemble the molecule wherever you like on the game board, but some places are easier to access than others. When the molecule is assembled, the level is won. The aim of the game is to solve the level in the least possible number of moves.
